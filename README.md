Each Character has Health Points and Skill Points, Items(to be equipped), Techniques(to be acquired or learned), Elemental Strengths and weaknesses(based on their type) and a Level based on Experience points XP. In a team where the party contains 2 or more of the same type of elemental character, each character of that given type earns a 10% bonus in attack power and health. If a party member has a greater elemental type, partners with a weaker elemental type earn 10% bonus in defense and skill points for each partner with a stronger element. 

Elements:
Water[stronger] douses Fire[weaker]
Fire Scorches Earth
Earth withstands Thunder
Thunder pierces the Atmosphere(Wind)
Wind moves the Tide(Water)

Engineer, Android – Thunder
Soldier, Commander – Fire
Huntress, Assassin – Wind
Beastmaster, Swordsman – Earth
Healer, Mariner – Water

Specific Character types should inherit from the common base character. The level-up system should work as follows:

Level 1 health = 500 hp, xp needed for next level = (hp/20)^2.
